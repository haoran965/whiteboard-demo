[简体中文](./README_zh.md)

## 1. Applicable developers

- A web developer who is engaged in the development of online education software, online meetings, and remote collaboration software, and wants to quickly implant an interactive whiteboard in a short time.
- Have a certain TypeScript, React coding or reading foundation.
- If you want to develop components for the second time, you need to install lerna to start.

## 2. Advantage

The whole process is componentized. If you are not picky about the component's UI, you can just use the code in the `whiteboard` folder in the project. If you want to change the style of the component, you can customize the component under the premise of understanding the role of lerna and reading `DEV_README.md`.

## 3. Precautions

It is not safe for all Tokens in the demo to be hard-coded on the front end. It is recommended to have a server to call after the production environment.

## 4. Simply start the project

Simply starting a project means to directly apply the component code style in the project, and only write the "glue" code by yourself.

### 4.1 Get the SDK Token of Netless Whiteboard

1. Register a Netless account

   [Console](https://console.netless.link)

2. Get AppIdentifier

   Console -> Application management -> Click copy

3. Get SDK Token

   Console -> Application management -> Configuration -> Click copy

4. Complete the configuration, fill in the configuration file

   `.env.example` file name is changed to `.env`

   ```typescript
   APPIDENTIFIER=283/VGixxxxxx2HJg // Whiteboard APPIDENTIFIER
   SDKTOKEN=NETLESSSDK_YWs9eDRxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRkNTIyYjMwMmIyZGRj // Whiteboard SDKTOKEN
   ```

5. Safety Precautions

   After going online, this Token **It is recommended to maintain it in the backend**

### 4.2 Get Alibaba Cloud's `AK` `SK` (optional)

The process of synchronizing rich media such as videos and pictures on the whiteboard does not directly transmit these large-volume data through long connections, but uploads it to Alibaba Cloud's cloud storage and synchronizes the url address returned by the cloud storage. Under the premise that the developer understands that what is synchronized is the **address**, he should be able to figure out the basic elements required for the configuration of OSS during debugging:

1. For local debugging, we did not configure the proxy at the packaging layer, so cross-domain access should be enabled.

2. Shared reading is allowed, and can be changed to support various anti-theft links after going online.

3. You can upload by yourself (Needless to say, see the OSS documentation)

4. Debug configuration reference https://developer.netless.link/docs/faq/oss-config/

5. Complete the configuration, fill in the configuration file

   `.env.example` file name is changed to `.env`

   ```typescript
   AK=LTAI4xxxxxxxxxxuDmu
   SK=ycdfrOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWqsy
   OSSREGION=oss-cn-hangzhou
   BUCKET=bxxxxxxxgs
   FOLDER=testxxxxx
   PREFIX=https://bxxxxxxxgs.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/
   ```

6. If you don't want to configure cloud storage, please comment out the following code and run it directly. But you cannot use the core functions such as uploading pictures, audio and video, PPT, etc.

   ```tsx
    <ToolBox room={room} customerComponent={
           [
               <OssUploadButton oss={ossConfigObj}
                    room={room}
                    whiteboardRef={whiteboardLayerDownRef}/>,
               <PluginCenter oss={ossConfigObj}
                     room={room}/>
           ]
   }/>
   
   // changed to
   <ToolBox room={room}/>
   ```
7. Safety Precautions
    
    After going online, this Config **It is recommended to maintain it in the backend**

### 4.3 Startup project

```bash
# Access to the whiteboard folder
cd whiteboard
# Load dependencies
pnpm install
# Startup project
pnpm dev
# Packaged project
pnpm build
```

## 5. Component secondary development

We assume that the developers who need secondary development are deep players and need to be familiar with some front-end engineering and component-related tools.

- yarn or npm
- lerna (There is a simple way to run it below, please search and learn by yourself for detailed usage)

### 5.1 Component introduction

The advantage of using lerna management is: the common functions of the componentized whiteboard are convenient to use, maintain and manage. The following briefly lists the core components, and introduces their functions and styles.

# or npm install
npm install lerna -g

# Start hot update of all scripts
lerna run --parallel dev

# Yarn build command to build all libraries

# Run only the yarn dev script of toolbox
lerna run --scope `lib-name` dev
# lerna run --parallel  --scope @netless/toolbox --scope whiteboard dev
